# TheLoneSurvivor_SourceCode

The Lone Survivor Source Code made it with CryEngine 5.7 lts, my intention with this is code, was practice with C++ Templates to understanding it and see how the templates can help during development and try to make some tools, like reusable components, etc.
This repository also contains the assets I've used in this project, but those assets can only be used in CryEngine, there is not fbx or tif files.
I hope this project can be useful as start point for fps project using CryEngine.
